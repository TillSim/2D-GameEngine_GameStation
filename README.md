# GameStation

This **demo project** is my first attempt at creating a **2D-Game** from scratch.

General purpose of this endeavor is to test already learned concepts and experiment with different design patterns.

>Please **be aware** that since this project is intended as a learning experience, the **engine is prone to changes** of basic structures (e.g. GUI-framework etc.) in the future.

## Features
- Dynamic sprite loading (import of new maps / tiles / char-sprites)
- Adjustable tile-size / aspect-ratio / frames-per-second
- Dynamic animation based on the amount of imported sprites and movement / animation speed
- Collision detection system
- 3 different movement speeds
- Camera control system (rpg-style fixed camera)



## Roadmap
- Interactive in-game objects
- Persistence (config / save files)
- Inventory and in-game-menu system
- HUD
- Sound handling
- NPC and combat system
- Rendering performance optimization
